# 🎯 Guess My Number!

A simple number guessing game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to practice **DOM manipulation** and interactive logic.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The game generates a **random number between 1 and 20**
- The player has to guess the number by entering input and clicking **"Check!"**
- Feedback is shown:
  - `"Too High"` or `"Too Low"` for incorrect guesses
  - `"Hurray! You matched the secret number"` for a correct guess
- The player starts with a **score of 20**, which decreases with each wrong guess
- A **"Highscore"** is tracked across game sessions
- The **"Again!"** button resets the game without reloading the page
